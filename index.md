Welcome to **DCZia**

We are a casual group of friends who all are somehow related to the 505 area. Although most of us have reloacated we shared common roots and wanted to keep working together to create some awesome stuff. We make badges to challeng ourselves, learn something new, and make some weird stuff that we can show off.

# [](#header-1)About DCZia

Back in 2014 Litho and Jediguy had a crazy idea to make a badge for Defcon after seeing some of the other amazing groups making designs. Egged on by Hamster, Houdini, and Toasty we formed up a group and here we are today. We grew in numbers and we are looking to come up with even more creative ideas ever year.

## [](#header-2)Current Badge (DefCon 26)

DefCon 26's theme is 1983 and we decided to build upon our idea for last years badge. We are working on a mechanical key based badge with lights and animation, and whatever else we can stick in there. New Retro meets Badgelife.
