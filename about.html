							<p>Originating around DEF CON 22, DCZia is a group organized around the concepts of teaching, learning, and creating badges / other electronic hardware. Most of us have loose ties to New Mexico, but now we live all over the US. DCZia welcomes both newcomers and experts alike. Proud holders of the DC DarkNet DEF CON 25 Black Badge!</p>
                            
							<h2>History</h2>

                            <dl>
									<dt>2013</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>@toasty, @lithochasm, @jediguybob threw around the idea of forming an informal group exploring the concepts of sharing knowledge, learning new skills, and creating a badge.</p>
									</dd>
									
                                <dt>2014</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>@toasty, @lithochasm, @jediguybob, and @bitrunnr competed in the DC network forensics challenge. @kexel introduces @gateherder to the group. Nameless group semi-organizes at the pestering of @hamster and @houdini. Various shenanigans ensue.
										<br>▪️ Badge: Laserdisc Badge (found laying on a table in the chill room. Worn around like a flava-flav clock by LithoChasm all con)</p>
									</dd>
									
                                <dt>2015</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Group organized under Tilted Kuipers, but due to lack of communication, @tiltedkuipers is also used as a dcdarknet username. @tiltedkuipers and @kexel come in 3rd and 11th in dcdarknet.
										<br>▪️ Badge: PiBadge Mk1 - Raspberry Pi // 3.5” Full Color LCD – The first badge (Designed by LithoChasm, group built and refined by DCZia)</p>

                                <dt>2016</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Group renamed DCZia. @tiltedkuipers and @kexel sink in dcdarknet standings, get angry and depressed, and decide to “go big or go home” next year.

									<br>▪️ Badge: PiBadge Mk2 - Raspberry Pi // 3.5” Full Color LCD // Custom Visuals from Beeple remixed by LithoChasm</p>
									</dd>
                                
                                <dt>2017</dt>

										<p>DCZia tackles their most ambitious badge design yet, and our first single pcb design. @gateherder and @kexel help with DCDarkNet this year. SAO's take over the world this year, and DCZia contributes numerous designs from @hamster, @jediguybob, @lithochasm, @gateherder and @kexel

										<p>Life happened. We didn't have time to make a PCB badge this year but still wanted to do something for everyone, so we chose to do an open-source build at home desk badge!

											Hybrid mode! ZiaCon was remote, but Defcon29 was a hybrid affair.  Decided to do a one-shot badge design on night one of ZiaCon.
											<br>▪️ Badge: ZiaCon YOLO badge
											<br>▪️ DefCon29: YOLO puzzle
											<!--VectorVector Cipher FeedBack Loops: IHEnf505%20c%206--> 
										</p>
										<p>
											Puzzle Overview (spoilers ahead...)
											<br>For DefCon29, with the DCZia crew split both in-person and attending remotely we decided this would be a great chance to run a mini-contest to get one of the YOLO badges. 
											<br>We announced it via <a href="https://twitter.com/DCZia505/status/1423486300363972608">Twitter</a> which decoded to our <a href="http://dczia.net/super-space-house.html">puzzle page.</a>
											<br>The remote team was able to support the social media communications between everyone who was participating. The in-person crew confirmed winners and handed out the YOLO prize!
