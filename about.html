							<p>Originating around DEF CON 22, DCZia is a group organized around the concepts of teaching, learning, and creating badges / other electronic hardware. Most of us have loose ties to New Mexico, but now we live all over the US. DCZia welcomes both newcomers and experts alike. Proud holders of the DC DarkNet DEF CON 25 Black Badge!</p>
                            
                            <h2>History</h2>

                            <dl>
									<dt>2013</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>@toasty, @lithochasm, @jediguybob threw around the idea of forming an informal group around the concepts of sharing knowledge, learning new skills, and creating a badge.</p>
									</dd>
									
                                <dt>2014</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>@toasty, @lithochasm, @jediguybob, and @bitrunnr competed in the DC network forensics challenge. @kexel introduces @gateherder to the group. Nameless group semi-organizes at the pestering of @hamster and @houdini. Various shenanigans ensue.

                                <dt>2015</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Group organized under Tilted Kuipers, but due to lack of communication, @tiltedkuipers is also used as a dcdarknet username. @tiltedkuipers and @kexel come in 3rd and 11th in dcdarknet.
